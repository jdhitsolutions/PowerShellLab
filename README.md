# PowerShellLab

## Deprecated

This lab configuration is no longer maintained in this repository. They are part of the [PSAutolab](https://github.com/pluralsight/PS-AutoLab-Env) module. It is recommended you look at the README file in that repository.

You can install the PSAutolab module from the PowerShell Gallery.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PSAutolab
```

This repository is maintained for historical purposes and should not be used for new installations.

## Legacy Instructions

To use the scripts and configurations, download the [current release ](https://github.com/jdhitsolutions/PowerShellLab/archive/0.10.0.zip). Extract the contents of the zip file folder to your Autolab Configurations directory. You should end up with something like C:\Autolab\Configurations\PowerShellLab which contains the files from this repository.

```powershell
PS C:\> dir C:\Autolab\Configurations\PowerShellLab\


    Directory: C:\Autolab\Configurations\PowerShellLab

-a----        8/25/2017   7:35 PM           6020 VMValidate.test.ps1
```

Change to that directory and continue with the Autolab setup instructions.

## Domain Setup

Domain name: Company.pri
Password for all accounts is: `P@ssw0rd`

You most likely will want to use one or more of these accounts.

- The user Art Deco (ArtD) is a member of the Domain Admins group.
- The user April Showers (AprilS) is a member of the Domain Admins group.
- The user Mike Smith (MikeS) is a standard, non-domain admin, user.

## Servers

All servers run an evaluation version of Windows Server 2016 Core:

- DOM1 Domain Controller
- SRV1 Domain Member server
- SRV2 Domain Member server
- SRV3 Workgroup server

## Desktops

- Win10 - Windows 10 Enterprise (evaluation version) with Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) installed.
- PowerShell remoting has been enabled. You will need to run `Update-Help` and manually install items like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Notes

- All computers are set for Mountain Time with a location of Phoenix, Arizona.
- It is strongly recommended that you run Windows update on the virtual machines, especially the Windows 10 client.
- The PostSetup folder contains a number of optional scripts you might want to run after the Autolab setup is complete. It has a separate [README](./PostSetup/README.md) file.
- To connect to a virtual machine, in a PowerShell prompt you can use the `vmconnect` command: `vmconnect localhost win10` where you specify the name of the Hyper-V host (your local machine) and the name of the virtual machine.
